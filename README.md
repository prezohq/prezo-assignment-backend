# prezo-assignment-backend

Hi there, thanks for your interest in (Prezo)[https://prezo.ai]. We are excited to work with builders and hackers to help us shape Prezo.

A common need when hacking on Prezo is to setup endpoints for querying AI models. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a working version of one such endpoint.

## Requirements

- Create an API endpoint that accepts a prompt.

- It should query OpenAI for text completion. You will need an API KEY from OpenAI - They offer $18 in credits for first 3 months.

- Return the result returned by OpenAI.

- How will you make this fault tolerant? Think about all the ways in which this simple endpoint can fail and write your ideas on how we can handle failures. If you code up mitigating solutions as part of the endpoint, even better.

- OpenAI can fail to serve results or rate limit the queries. How will you work around it?

- You can use Python or Node or something else for this. 

## Deliverables

- Create a repo with your code in it. 

- Host it on render/railway/heroku/or any other service with free tier.

- Record a short video walking us through how you crushed this

- Share the repo, the video and the hosted app with us

If you are out of OpenAI credits, contact us for a key.
